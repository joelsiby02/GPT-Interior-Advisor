### The AI Agent Pipeline

The core of this project is a "crew" of AI agents, each with a specific role. They work together in a pipeline to build your design plan:

1.  **üé® Design Agent**: Receives the user's request (`room`, `style`) and generates initial ideas for layout, color palettes, and overall mood.
2.  **üîç Product Agent**: Takes the design concept and searches for specific furniture and decor items that match the style.
3.  **üí∞ Budget Agent**: Reviews the product list, calculates the total cost, and removes items if the selection exceeds the user's budget.
4.  **‚úçÔ∏è Summary Agent**: Compiles the final design ideas and the budget-approved product list into a clean, easy-to-read report for the user.

This collaborative approach ensures the final output is creative, relevant, and practical.
